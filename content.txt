" It works on my computer! "
   Server crashed. Again.   
  code first, sleep later   
zero errors, still panicking.
     Ctrl+Z = god mode      
 I can fix it, maybe later  
    This is fine, right?    
 No error? I donâ€™t trust it 
 Debugging is just guessing 
  git commit -m "fixed it"  
  This is definitely a bug  
  StackOverflow saves lives 
    I regret this commit

    keyboard broke itself   
     " should be fine "     
    syntax error? AGAIN?!   
     WiFi left the chat     
   the API betrayed me...   
     I am the bug now...    
     IT WORKED?? NO WAY     
    codeing is suffering    
    404 sleep not found

  let's make it work later  
    syntax? what syntax?

   code works... for now    
       code: 1, me: 0       
     ctrl+s, my savior
